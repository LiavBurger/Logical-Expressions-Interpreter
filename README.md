## Introduction

<p align="left">
  
In this project I implemented a system that can represent nested logical expressions that include variables, 
evaluate their values for specific variable assignments, convert them, and simplify the results.

It can be used to:
* Evaluate and simplify logical expressions.
* Performs procedures on the expression such as nandify and norify.
